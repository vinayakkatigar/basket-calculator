Step 1: Shopping cart
  You are building a checkout system for a shop which only sells apples and oranges
• Apples cost 60p and oranges cost 25p
• Build a checkout system which takes a list of items scanned at the till and outputs the total cost
- For example: [ Apple, Apple, Orange, Apple ] => £2.05
Step 2: Simple offers
The shop decides to introduce two new offers
- Buy one, get one free on apples
- 3 for the price of 2 on oranges
• Update your checkout functions acBuy one
